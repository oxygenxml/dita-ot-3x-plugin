# DITA-OT 3.x Publishing Engine add-on - THIS ADD-ON IS DEPRECATED BECAUSE NEWER VERSIONS OF OXYGEN COME WITH DITA OT 3.x BUNDLED
Add-on that adds capabilities for publishing using DITA-OT 3.x (DITA Open Toolkit version 3.1). Compatible with Oxygen 20.1 and newer.

How to install
--------------
1. In Oxygen, go to **Help->Install new add-ons** to open an add-on selection dialog box.
2. Enter or paste https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxygenxml/dita-ot-3x-plugin/master/add-on.xml in the **Show add-ons from** field or select it from the drop-down menu.
3. Select the **DITA OT 3.x publishing engine** add-on and click **Next**.
4. Select the **I accept all terms of the end user license agreement** option and click **Finish**.
5. Restart the application.

Result: In the Oxygen Preferences->DITA page, you will now have a new "DITA OT 3.x" radio button entry that you can check to publish all DITA content using DITA OT 3.x by default.
